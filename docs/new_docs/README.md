# DomainForge Documentation — New Docs (Diataxis)

This folder contains newly scaffolded documentation using the Diataxis framework: Tutorials, How-Tos, Reference, Explanations, and Playbooks.

## Purpose

Provide a MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) layout for documentation that supports different reader intents:

- Tutorials: learn by doing — focused, goal-oriented, step-by-step guides.
- How-Tos: task-oriented instructions for completing a specific task.
- Reference: canonical, stable API, grammar, error codes, config, CLI commands.
- Explanations: conceptual background, architecture, rationale.
- Playbooks: runbooks for operators, maintainers, and contributors to handle procedures and workflows.

Maintainers: Use the README files in each subfolder to document what belongs there and include a minimal checklists for required items.

---

> Tips:
>
> - Keep files small and focused: one task, one concept, one reference item.
> - Prefer linking between pages rather than duplicating content.
> - Provide “Try it” sections in tutorials and “Examples” in reference pages.
