# PRD Section 8 – UX & Design

- **Sequences**: Model validation and streaming diagrams reveal parity and diagnostics requirements that go beyond textual PRD descriptions.
- **State coverage**: State diagram enumerates error and edge-case handling, fulfilling the requirement to surface non-happy paths.
- **Follow-up**: Clarify retry policy for `ErrorState` transitions; PRD currently silent.
