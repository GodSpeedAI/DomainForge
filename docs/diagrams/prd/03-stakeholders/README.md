# PRD Section 3 – Stakeholders & Roles

- **RACI coverage**: Product Manager set as accountable; Platform Engineer, BA, CO, QA, DevRel responsible for respective PRD obligations.
- **Communication loops**: Diagram emphasises bidirectional BA ↔ CO and QA ↔ PM flows needed for governance, per PRD success metrics.
- **Gap flag**: Data Scientist persona lacks explicit decision authority in PRD; treat as consulted for analytics features.
- **Follow-up**: Clarify who is accountable for CALM interoperability (PRD-014) once resourced.
