# PRD Section 6 – Personas & Scenarios

- **Business analyst journey**: Highlights frustration with diagnostics and collaboration, aligning with PRD-017 and PRD-019 backlog.
- **Persona coverage**: Comparison map shows overlapping needs (bindings, diagnostics) across personas to justify shared investments.
- **Gaps**: PRD lacks explicit data scientist journey; treat analytics tooling as secondary persona pending research.
