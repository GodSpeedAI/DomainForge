# PRD Section 5 – Scope & Out-of-Scope

- **Coverage**: Clarifies SEA DSL release footprint, emphasising interoperability and operations as core scope while excluding UI builders, SSO, and transactional ERP features.
- **Decision guardrails**: Decision tree ties inclusion to semantic, parity, interoperability, or release objectives.
- **Warnings**: UI tooling and analytics ownership ambiguous in PRD; documented as out-of-scope pending clarification.
