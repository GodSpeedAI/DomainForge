# PRD Section 2 – Objectives & Metrics

- **Goal coverage**: Performance, usability, interoperability, and delivery excellence are decomposed and linked back to PRD success metrics.
- **Measurement plan**: Owners assigned per metric so KPIs are testable; draws from PRD acceptance criteria and success metrics.
- **Risks**: PRD lacks explicit numeric targets for documentation quality surveys beyond >4/5—verify baseline instrumentation.
- **Actions**: Establish benchmark automation in CI (per PRD-018) and confirm UX research cadence for comprehension studies.
