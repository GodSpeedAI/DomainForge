# PRD Section 1 – Overview & Context

- **Intent**: Capture SEA DSL system boundary, core personas, and all external touchpoints enumerated in docs/specs/prd.md overview.
- **Interfaces covered**: ERP5 UBM migration, CALM export, CI/CD regression harness, analytics/Next.js consumers.
- **Gaps noted**: PRD does not describe UI authoring layers or governance tooling; these remain out of scope.
- **Next steps**: Validate interfaces with architecture runway (ADR-00x) and confirm additional stakeholder tooling if planned.
