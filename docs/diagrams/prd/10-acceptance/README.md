# PRD Section 10 – Acceptance Criteria

- **Workflow**: Ensures every acceptance criterion loops back to its originating requirement and KPI before release.
- **Traceability**: Aligns with test IDs defined in Section 7 README so QA can cross-reference easily.
- **Note**: Failures explicitly return to requirement refinement, reflecting PRD emphasis on semantic correctness over schedule.
