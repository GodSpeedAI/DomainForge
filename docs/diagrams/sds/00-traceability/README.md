## Traceability Assets Overview

- `sds-traceability-adr-mapping.md`: Enumerates where each ADR decision manifests within the SDS diagram set.
- `sds-traceability-req-mapping.md`: Provides requirement coverage matrix tying `REQ-###` aliases to PRD items, implementing components, diagrams, and validation assets.
- `sds-traceability-component-index.md`: Canonical list of component IDs used across all diagrams with dependency metadata.
- `sds-adr-impact-report.md`: Deep-dive impact narratives per ADR.
- `sds-requirement-coverage-report.md`: Summarises fulfilment status (Full/Partial/Deferred) for every requirement.
- `sds-diagram-validation-report.md`: Checklist capturing quality gates and open issues identified during diagram generation.
